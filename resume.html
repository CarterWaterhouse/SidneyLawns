                        <h2 class="small_heading">Sidney Lawn & Labour | Greater Victoria</h2>
                        <p class="text">I have been running my business since 2021. My business has taught me who I am and the
                            skills needed to operate a successful business. Those skills include: building schedules,
                            communicating with clients, project management, marketing, and time management. The
                            strongest gain from this experience is my communication skills that were pivotal to gaining
                            and maintaining healthy and enjoyable relationships with my clients</p>
                        <h2 class="medium_heading">Climbing Coach 2019 - 2021</h2>
                        <h2 class="small_heading">Boulder's Climbing Gym | Brentwood</h2>
                        <p class="text">Boulder's was my first step into becoming the most successful I could be. While I worked as
                            a coach teaching young climbers fundamental skills to climbing, I learned my strongest skill,
                            communication. My strong ability to talk and work with the young climbers let me
                            effectively manage class time and climber enjoyment to get the most out of every session.
                            For this experience, I went through a dedicated course to get my CGI (Climbing Gym
                            Instructor) license.</p>

                        <p class="text">Running my business has always been my biggest acomplishment, and having started the company in 
                            my junior year of highschool stands as one of my most notable acomplishments</p>

                            growing dirt jump biking community. I have dedicated time towards going out and fixing
                            areas in need. Part of my commitment towards the park is to be a leader in the public work
                            parties, where I lead a group of people to work on a section of the park</p>
